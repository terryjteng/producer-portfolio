            <p>
              At Riot Games, I led the implementation of a vendor management and
              catalog system on the External Development team using Airtable
              that supported over $100M in development work and facilitated more
              than 500 vendor engagements. By dissecting existing workflows,
              introducing automation, and conducting in-depth research
              initiatives, I was able to identify and eliminate key bottlenecks,
              communication gaps, and approval delays across production
              pipelines. This effort significantly improved transparency,
              reduced operational friction, and empowered stakeholders with
              real-time visibility into vendor status and
              deliverables—ultimately streamlining Riot’s external partner
              ecosystem for game development.

              After my time with the External Development team, I transitioned
              onto the Product Solutions team to help drive the success of some
              of the studio’s most profitable game features by leveraging my
              background in production and workflow optimization. I collaborated
              closely with product managers, engineers, and analysts to pitch
              scalable solutions that addressed developer pain points and
              aligned with long-term strategic goals. My role focused on
              identifying operational inefficiencies, proposing feature
              enhancements, and connecting team needs with practical,
              data-informed improvements—ensuring that our solutions not only
              improved internal workflows but directly supported
              revenue-generating initiatives across Riot’s game portfolio.

            <div class="modal-text">
              <p>As Head of Production for the backend team at Xsolla, I led a comprehensive overhaul of the team's operational structure, managing a global team of backend game engineers responsible for internal product tools and external developer services. I introduced Agile practices, established clear sprint cadences, and drove the adoption of tools and workflows that increased team productivity by 50%. I developed strategic roadmaps, aligned technical initiatives with stakeholder objectives, and created scalable processes that brought visibility and structure to product delivery. My leadership ensured transparency and accountability across departments while empowering engineers with repeatable frameworks and performance tracking tools. This transformation not only improved execution across backend initiatives but also established a foundation for sustainable growth across a distributed engineering organization..</p>

              <p>I spearheaded the planning and revival of Arcane Showdown in partnership with Big Huge Games, taking the lead as the primary point of contact for all production efforts. I collaborated closely with stakeholders across product, engineering, and design teams to dissect the pitfalls of the game’s previous launch and reimagine its development trajectory. By aligning Xsolla’s backend engineering capabilities with Big Huge’s creative and gameplay needs, I implemented strategic development workflows that addressed technical bottlenecks, improved cross-team communication, and redefined milestone planning. My efforts not only reestablished production momentum but also created a sustainable development framework that positioned the game for a successful re-entry into the market.</p>
