        <h3>üõ°Ô∏è "Tale of the Producer‚Äôs Path" üó°Ô∏è</h3>

        <p>
          ‚ÄúHearken, traveler, to the tale of Terry Teng ‚Äî for his path winds not
          through taverns and tombs, but through the strange wilds of the
          working realm.‚Äù Born with a scroll in hand and a degree in the ancient
          art of marketing, Terry ventured into the world eager for glory. But
          lo ‚Äî the land of marketing proved barren, its halls lined not with
          creativity, but with unyielding spreadsheets. And so, he pivoted. From
          the high halls of the Citadel of Google, Terry joined the Order of
          Customer Experience ‚Äî there, he helped launch a mighty artifact known
          as Google Local Services, a tool that changed how townsfolk summoned
          tradefolk near and far. With this quest complete, he set his sights
          upon the southern kingdom ‚Äî Los Angeles. The road was treacherous. At
          the gates of CreatorIQ, he was met with plague and recession, and like
          many, was cast out in the time of COVID. Undeterred, Terry took up
          arms once more, joining the great house of NBC. But his heart yearned
          for the realm of games, and soon he crossed the threshold into the
          League itself ‚Äî becoming a Technical Producer at Riot Games. There he
          wielded his skills with precision, guiding projects, wrangling dragons
          (and vendors), and boosting skin sales like a bard selling ballads at
          a festival. Now he stands at the gates of Xsolla, having carved his
          path through trials, triumphs, and tavern talk alike. But even still ‚Äî
          his eyes look forward, to the next grand adventure... ...in a mighty
          gaming guild yet to come. ‚öîÔ∏è

        <h2>Professional Career</h2>
        <h3>Modern Translation</h3>
        <p>
          My professional career started after I graduated with a degree in
          marketing from Iowa State University, but quickly realized that
          marketing wasn‚Äôt for me once I started working at a few digital
          marketing agencies. I pivoted to project management, joining Google‚Äôs
          Customer Experience lab where I managed a team of researchers. After
          that, I had the opporunity to help launch a new product called Google
          Local Services, which was actually incubated by my team in the
          Customer Expereince lab. After relocating to Los Angeles, I faced some
          setbacks‚Äîincluding being laid off during COVID while at CreatorIQ.
          From there, I joined NBC and eventually made the leap into gaming as a
          Technical Producer at Riot Games. Now with my expereince as Head of
          Production at Xsolla, I‚Äôm looking forward to the next chapter in my
          journey in games and interactive entertainment.

        <h2>üéÆ Hobbies & Interests ü•ä</h2>
        <p>
          I feel like I have too many hobbies and intestets that a sane person
          should possess, but let's to get get into some of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, I love playing video games. I remember my obsession started
          when my cousin gave me my first Super Nintendo with Street Fighter II.
          From there, all I wanted to do was play games and fell deeply in love
          with RPGs: Chrono Trigger, Earth Bound, Final Fantasy. After upgrading
          I played a lot of FPSs in college and now back to RPGs. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides video games, I collect way too many things: Comic Books,
          Sneakers, Watches, Figurines, Vinyl Records, Tattoos.... I also start
          a million hobbies and drop them after a few weeks: Warmhammer 40K, 3D
          Printing, Cookking, Tufting, Streaming... I even started a podcast
          with my friends and trying to pick it back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also stay pretty active. The beach is my zen place. I also practice
          Muay Thai and lift weights almost every morning
